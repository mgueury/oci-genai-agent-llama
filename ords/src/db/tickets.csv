Get same error on ServerC which runs ORDS 25.1

Answer:
"" ADB SQL Net connection has always by default needed wallet.

You can disable mTLS. Then you need have ACL and specify IP addresses that can conect.
https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/autonomous-database-serverless/doc/support-tls-mtls-authentication.html

Error you get indicates that you have set some ACL, and that's why connection is blocked. Review ACL settings that you have specify correct IP.

48;16;ORDS 24.2, Tomcat, Error 571 - Database Connection Error;"Hi All,

I am getting this error message:

Database Connection Error
HTTP Status Code: 571
ORDS was unable to make a connection to the database. This can occur if the database is unavailable, the maximum number of sessions has been reached or the pool is not correctly configured. The connection pool named: |default|lo| had the following error(s): java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: /opt/oracle/product/23ai/dbhomeFree/network/admin/tnsnames.ora

I am able to deploy with ORDS jetty server. But, when I tried to deploy with tomcat 9, it is giving this error.

Answer:
Well, this is solved finally by adding the user (tomcat) to the user groups (oracle, oinstall).";16-Sep-24;16-Sep-24;1;16;
52;20;Fighting with ORDS and camelCase;"Hi all

I have the following view (let out extra columns):

create or replace view v_exp_camelcase
as
select api_system
,JSON_OBJECT(
'filterTest' VALUE filter
) val_api
from v_filter
;

The handler:
ORDS.DEFINE_HANDLER(
p_module_name => 'api_camelCaseFilter'
,p_pattern => 'test/'
,p_method => 'GET'
,p_source_type => ords.source_type_media
,p_source => 'select ''application/json'', val_api ""{}jsons"" from v_exp_camelcase where api_system = ''TEST'''
,p_items_per_page => 100
,p_mimes_allowed => 'application/json'
,p_comments => NULL
);

When executed in SQLDeveloper (GET => Edit), I get all the records. When executed in the browser, only one record is returned:

{""filter"": 0}

OK, let's try aggregating:

ORDS.DEFINE_HANDLER(
p_module_name => 'api_cus_anschluss-filter'
,p_pattern => 'test/'
,p_method => 'GET'
,p_source_type => ords.source_type_media
,p_source => 'select ''application/json'', JSON_OBJECT(''anschlussFilter'' VALUE JSON_ARRAYAGG(val_api)) ""{}jsons"" from v_exp_camelcase where api_system = ''TEST'''
,p_items_per_page => 100
,p_mimes_allowed => 'application/json'
,p_comments => NULL
);

Now, I get:
User Defined Resource Error
HTTP Status Code: 555


Error Code: ORDS-25001

The request could not be processed because an error occurred whilst attempting to evaluate a SQL statement associated with this resource. Verify that the URI and payload are correctly specified for the requested operation. If the issue persists then please contact the author of the resource. SQL Error Code: 40478, Error Message: ORA-40478: output value too large (maximum: 4000) https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-40478/

Thank you!

Answer:
Finally, I have managed to make it run. Using your example, a bit changed:
ORDS.DEFINE_HANDLER(
p_module_name => 'camel',
p_pattern => 'employees/',
p_method => 'GET',
p_source_type => ords.source_type_collection_feed,

54;22;How to get useful error stack when the PL/SQL code throws an exception;"Is there a way to retrieve the important error information from a PL/SQL error when using ORDS similar to how it was possible in the OHS/mod_plsql implementation

Answer:
I created a SR and this problem has actually been fixed in ORDS 25.1.

Unfortunately a possible caching error in ORDS 25.1 (see my post Unable to use ORDS 25.1 in container based development environment because of SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input) still prevents me to move away from the last “working” ORDS version 23.4.";22-Sep-24;22-Sep-24;5;22;
60;28;Getting the oauth2 new token asks for user and password ... which ones?;"I haven't seen this user pass popup in the tutorial I was following:
SQLDev Web: Securing RESTful Services in Oracle Autonomous Database with OAuth2 (0 Bytes)I also tried the curl command line, with --insecure, but got a nice Error 401--Unauthorized
The problem may be this: I'm using a weblogic development server with no proper certificate. The ~https~ in the browser is shown striked through
I tried to fix this configuring the self signed cert in the weblogic Adminserver SSL and loading the root.cer in my windows keystore as trusted.
Anyway, the browser still shows the server as insecure.

Answer:
We finally found the issue, it was a thing of a configuration error on weblogic that was capturing the auth requests before they were able to reach ORDS, as this is enabled by default and we did not disable this:

6.1.2.5 Configuring WebLogic to Handle HTTP Basic Challenges Correctly

By default WebLogic Server attempts to intercept all HTTP Basic Authentication challenges. This default behavior needs to be disabled for Oracle REST Data Services to function correctly. This is achieved by updating the enforce-valid-basic-auth-credentials flag. The WebLogic Server Administration Console does not display the enforce-valid-basic-auth-credentials setting. You can use WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) commands to check, and edit the value in a running server.";28-Sep-24;28-Sep-24;2;28;
