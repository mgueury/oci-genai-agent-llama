54;CustomerB;How to get useful error stack when the PL/SQL code throws an exception;"Is there a way to retrieve the important error information from a PL/SQL error when using ORDS similar to how it was possible in the OHS/mod_plsql implementation\n \n Answer:\n I created a SR and this problem has actually been fixed in ORDS 25.1.\n \n Unfortunately a possible caching error in ORDS 25.1 (see my post Unable to use ORDS 25.1 in container based development environment because of SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input) still prevents me to move away from the last “working” ORDS version 23.4.";22-Sep-24;22-Sep-24;5;22;
60;CustomerB;Getting the oauth2 new token asks for user and password ... which ones?;"I haven't seen this user pass popup in the tutorial I was following:\n SQLDev Web: Securing RESTful Services in Oracle Autonomous Database with OAuth2 (0 Bytes)I also tried the curl command line, with --insecure, but got a nice Error 401--Unauthorized\n The problem may be this: I'm using a weblogic development server with no proper certificate. The ~https~ in the browser is shown striked through\n I tried to fix this configuring the self signed cert in the weblogic Adminserver SSL and loading the root.cer in my windows keystore as trusted.\n Anyway, the browser still shows the server as insecure.\n \n Answer:\n We finally found the issue, it was a thing of a configuration error on weblogic that was capturing the auth requests before they were able to reach ORDS, as this is enabled by default and we did not disable this:\n \n https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-rest-data-services/22.3/ordig/deploying-and-monitoring-oracle-rest-data-services.html?source=marketeer&source=marketeer&source=marketeer&source=marketeer&source=marketeer#GUID-63AD5B59-CD6A-47A6-BBB4-0D614090C51F\n \n 6.1.2.5 Configuring WebLogic to Handle HTTP Basic Challenges Correctly\n \n By default WebLogic Server attempts to intercept all HTTP Basic Authentication challenges. This default behavior needs to be disabled for Oracle REST Data Services to function correctly. This is achieved by updating the enforce-valid-basic-auth-credentials flag. The WebLogic Server Administration Console does not display the enforce-valid-basic-auth-credentials setting.
